# Tunet Dashboard Card Suite

## Canonical Design Spec
**`Mockups/design_language.md` (v8.3)** is THE rulebook. Read it before building or modifying any card.
`tunet-design-system.md` (v2.1) is OUTDATED and superseded. Do not use its values.

## Quality Bar
**`Cards/tunet_climate_card.js`** (1513 lines) is the gold standard. Every card must match its token compliance, header pattern, surface treatment, interactions, and accessibility.

## Dark Mode: Midnight Navy (LOCKED)
- Canvas: `#0f172a`, Card surfaces: `#1e293b` → `rgba(30,41,59, 0.72)`
- Dark amber: `#fbbf24` (NOT `#E8961E`)
- Section-container dark: `rgba(30,41,59, 0.60)`
- Tile dark: `rgba(30,41,59, 0.90)`
- Dropdown dark: `rgba(30,41,59, 0.92)`
- Light mode tokens are UNCHANGED

## Key Rules (from design_language.md v8.3)
- All cards use §5 info-tile header (42px tappable entity identifier with icon + title + subtitle)
- All header controls share `--ctrl-bg`/`--ctrl-border`/`--ctrl-sh` idle surface
- Two-layer shadows everywhere (contact + ambient), never single-layer, never colored
- Icons: Material Symbols Rounded, outlined off (FILL 0), filled on (FILL 1)
- Touch targets: buttons >=42px, sliders >=44px
- `static getConfigForm()` — NEVER register imperative editor class

## Dashboard Config
`tunet-overview-config.yaml` — full overview: actions + status + lighting + environment + media + rooms
