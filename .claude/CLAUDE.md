## Project Documentation References

### ZEN32 LED State Machine
**File**: `docs/zen32_led_state_machine_reference.md`

Complete reference for ZEN32 LED behavior including:
- **Control Mode LEDs (Buttons 1-4)**: `mode_configs` mapping for brightness (yellow), volume (blue), warmth (cyan)
- **Big Button LED (Button 5)**: Priority-based OAL state indicator (sleep→blue, manual→red, config→green, adaptive→white)
- Z-Wave entity mappings and color/toggle/brightness value maps
- Two independent layers: control mode vs OAL system state
- Conflict analysis confirming orthogonal design

### Away Mode Feature (Planned)
**Files**:
- Issue: [GitHub #3: Comprehensive Away Mode System](https://github.com/macconnolly/interal-ha-dev/issues/3)
- Archive: `Backups/away_mode_implementation_plan.md`

Detailed specification for away mode feature (currently planned, not implemented). Document includes:
- 8 new entities with insertion points
- 3 automations (controller, activity monitor, notification handler)
- Modifications for sunrise manager & wake-up sequence
- Complete implementation sequence (25 minutes)
- Testing protocol & rollback procedures
- Dashboard integration examples
